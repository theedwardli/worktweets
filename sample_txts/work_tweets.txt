Ever feel like you'll never finish that dream project?  Work on it a little bit at a time. Each day, do some actual work or do some daydreaming about it. Here's the key: make progress, even if it's many tiny steps. Later, you'll discover you finished it. Then do the next thing!
the way they do it is at first to appeal to faith -- things can work out, don't lose hope, its a long shot, etc - -and then to threats -- you'll be sorry if you don't believe us

I wish I had more people that I could connect with on a deeper level. There are people in my life now that I’ve know for some time...but I still don’t really know them. I don’t get the point of relationships if we put so much work into keeping ourselves from real connections.

@GoCubs49 Most of it is rightfully so tho. He has 2 fantastic receivers and a pretty good tight end but can barley squeak in the playoffs. His O-line is in question at times but they’re at least top 20 in the league and a good QB should be able to work with that.

but the purpose was to create a literally heart stopping moment, and demonstrate the impact that effectively composed "silence" can have.   There was no other way to approach that scene that would create this effect, so it took breaking some hard and fast rules to make it work
@ColinDexter7 That would work too

Finally: these tactics work by playing on existing divisions, and the existence of these tactics does not negate the existence of the divisions. Addressing the divisions would be one obvious way to immunize against the tactics. And it would be a good idea regardless.

A glass company in NJ  A dishwasher in FL  A carpet company  A plumber  Painters  48 waiters  Bartenders  Real estate brokers  &amp; law firms  All claim Trump never paid them for their work.  Now, as president, Trump wants to shutdown government &amp; not pay America’s public servants.

I feel like despite knowing there wasn’t a balance between the return/work I would’ve put out there, I still passed on an opportunity? But then I feel silly in thinking that.   Being in your own head while also maintaining a belief of what your time is worth is a hell of a ride.

Students defrauded by for-profit colleges should not face financial ruin while their government turns a blind eye. This decision is a direct result of students, alumni and advocates demanding the Dept. of Education take action. Big first step but more work to be done. https://t.co/rvFUrLQbFX

@Muttmere1 @jo_farrall Why do some affirmed trans kids commit suicide?  Because they don’t feel safe at school or at work.  Because wait times for medical support are long or that support is cost-prohibitive.  Because of people online who chronically invalidate their experience.  All those reasons.
Let’s enter 2019 with the right energy:  Trans women are women Sex work is work  Black lives matter  Nazi lives don’t matter  Rape culture is real Yes all men Fuck white supremacy  Abolish borders  Free Palestine  Protect indigenous rights  Support mental health   Believe women

@KarlHerrup @pollyp1 Wow! We can do better by looking at what works. Acknowledge the bias and actively work against it! Pay parity should not take years. Put more women in high positions and parity will follow quickly.
I don't see why being single gets a bad rap. I buy boats and guns and trucks whenever I want. I work however long I want and sleep whenever I feel like. It's pretty dang awesome!

Pune: Samajbandh, an organisation from Pune makes sanitary napkins out of old clothes and distribute them among tribal women in the nearby villages. Sachin, founder of Samajbandh says, "I started this work 2 years ago and we have reached to more than 2000 women." #Maharashtra https://t.co/B18xBPv3R8
@GregRicker4 Yeah, animated can work. As long as it inspires a description and allows it to be consistent.
Work Hard! Tabata HIIT class with Rebecca Bash @CowboysFit followed by 20 min sauna at 180 degrees. No excuses... #GetItDone. You can start by making more time in your life by leveraging tools like #CEWhenever @HomeCEU. https://t.co/lCI7UPRcrn
@Chellibabbbyy That wouldn’t work for my family

@realDonaldTrump I assume any farmer receiving this handout will need to take a drug test &amp; prove he is actively looking for other work?

No other Korean artist was reviewed by the trinity of @pitchfork @nytimes + @RollingStone this year. Very favorably. Leave behind those who will ONLY evaluate @BTS_twt’s work in the context of other K acts. It’s an insult to the calibre of their work. Big fish swim in the big sea
Do your future self a huge ass favor and work hard now
We were so lucky to have @murmic from Saint Mary’s High School come in and work with our Intermediate volleyball players today. He is such a great coach we all learned from him. Our team of coaches here certainly benefitted as did our students. #blessed #BGCLearns @osstmarys https://t.co/nsNPpg97MN
I’m going to attempt to do my makeup in the morning before work. So let me go to sleep early so I can prepare to have a bad day, after I don’t get the look I’m going for.
Another massive union win at #LabConf18. Nationally consistent industrial manslaughter laws. Kill a worker, go to jail. It makes sense and will help stop deaths at work.
Tbh Church is the easy part. Bible study etc is all easy. The real work starts when it's mid week and you're tired. When your flesh wants to scream and you have to put your spirit first. When you have to consider Gods opinion even if you're not in the mood.. That's when it starts
@ragegirlymgmt That would be a good idea. I'm off work by 5 at the latest. Just in time for dinner 🙌🏻  Oooooo I'd watch!!
Let's go to work. https://t.co/jQrMQKrJXK

What Jin said : We even were struggling to have half a mind to disband in early of this year. But it’s good we finally made this good result after we settled ourselves down to work hard again. Thank to the members and thank to ARMYs who love us always. https://t.co/Shph8CProk

Was so hangry, stopped at the store after work to start tacos right after work. Instead I have been sitting here for 45 minutes listening to Mariah Carey/My Chemical Romance Christmas mashups

As you gather with your family this year there are STILL more than 13K CHILDREN being held like prisoners away from their loved ones so Trump could throw a political tantrum, use migrants as the election boogeymen. It didn’t work. You TOOK the kids, now return them. #Christmas https://t.co/xhp1aYDLqc

The day you plant the seed is not the day you eat the fruit. Be patient and keep moving forward. All of the hard work you put in behind the scenes, day in and day out, will produce the results you’ve been looking for. Your time is coming. You’re up next. Do not give up.
@SeanSJordan @thegissilent @IanKarmel @MarsMel I just wanna say that listening to the pod really kept me goin thru finals, esp these last couple christmas ep.s   y’all doin the lord’s work 😤🤝💕
And we also thank God continually because,   when you received the word of God,   which you heard from us,   you accepted it not as a human word,   but as it actually is,   the word of God,   which is indeed at work in you who believe.   1 Thessalonians 2:13   #Bible #BibleVerses

Stephen Miller needs to be a regular on TV combatting the left.   The media can not out talk him, their gotcha questions don’t work.  Miller dominates them with most simple words &amp; he cleverly destroys them with facts!   Bring him on MORE @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/SkKXA4ontd

@allansoutar @Plantmore1 @bigbushelsag @Mochapup44 @dennydenny1020 The only Massey I have is an old 35, I've never bought anything from RME, I wish I had a DOT but I don't and I don't work for a construction company. I like hats. I wear lots of them. Some are companies I love, some I have been given but wearing one does not put me on a payroll https://t.co/LKHnrJEj8i
@UWBone24 She seems much more authentic as a Heel. Just look at her NXT work as an example.
