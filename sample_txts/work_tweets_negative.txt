Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in jobs so insecure they can't plan childcare or budget for their weekly shop. The govt's ‘good work plan’ is too little, too late. They should be banning zero-hours contracts, not telling workers to ask their boss for a better deal. https://t.co/5DI37N8F9j
PELOSI not budging. Just told a small group of reporters: "The wall is not about money. The wall is about morality. It’s the wrong thing to do. It doesn’t work. Its not effective. It’s the wrong thing to do and it’s a waste of money."

Stop making excuses.  Even if in the middle of work, school, &amp; all other things, prioritize your personal time with God. It’s a priority.  There are so much to accomplish in life but don't forget that there are also so much that God has to accomplish in you.  Stay rooted in Him.

Not sure if I should take my acrylics off or get a fill and cut them shorter for work 🤦🏻‍♀️
The govt's workers' rights plans are but baby steps. They won't produce the leap needed to give millions in insecure work the security of knowing they can feed their kids and pay the bills. Any approach that refuses unions a key role will not create an economy that works for all.

**PLEASE SHARE *** Hey Hivemind... so let's do this and see how far we get. On Thursday evening my bag, containing my mum's old laptop, two hard drives and my glasses was stolen from a private work party at the soho sanctum hotel... (1 of 3)..
@AngelaRayner You really are a contrary nasty piece of work. SNP have repeatedly offered to work with labour and got slapped down for their trouble. Somebody needs to oppose brexit, clearly it's not going to be you. And btw your tweet reeks of entitlement. SNP are more socialist than labour.
ppl do all this dirty shit to you and expect you to be the same person! NO it don't work like that... I'm as loyal as they come but once you cross me you'll forever get a different me! PERIODT

@Femi_Sorry Yes, evil is the word. We #Brexpats not only made a choice, we exercised our right to live, love, learn and work in another EU country, believing that we had those rights for ever. We never thought we’d be abandoned by our own country.
